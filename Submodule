Yes, I grouped the test cases into 5 categories based on the user story. Here's a **consolidated version** where **one representative test case** is written for each of the 5 categories â€” giving you a **total of 5 key test cases**, each covering a core requirement of the story.

## âœ… **Top 5 Test Cases Based on Categories**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **1. CloudWatch Log Group Submodule Creation**

**Test Case 1: Validate CloudWatch Log Group Creation for SageMaker in Model Build A/C**

* **Preconditions:** Terraform submodule for CloudWatch log groups is available and configured.
* **Test Steps:**

  1. Deploy the Terraform module in the Model Build account.
  2. Navigate to AWS Console â†’ CloudWatch â†’ Log Groups.
  3. Search for a log group matching `/aws/sagemaker/*`.
* **Expected Result:**

  * Log group for SageMaker exists with proper naming.
  * Terraform apply completes without error.
* **Objective:** Ensure log groups are provisioned as expected by the Terraform module.

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Cross-Account Log Sharing to Governance Account**

**Test Case 2: Validate Logs Are Forwarded from Source to Governance Account**

* **Preconditions:** Subscription filter or log destination is configured to forward logs to Governance account.
* **Test Steps:**

  1. Trigger an event in the Model Build account (e.g., SageMaker job or Lambda execution).
  2. Check CloudWatch in the Governance account for incoming logs.
* **Expected Result:**

  * Logs from the source account appear in the Governance account.
  * Destination ARN (e.g., Kinesis, Firehose) is correct.
* **Objective:** Confirm that cross-account log forwarding is working.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **3. Source Account Tagging**

**Test Case 3: Verify Log Group Tagging for Source Identification**

* **Preconditions:** Log group tagging is enabled in the Terraform module.
* **Test Steps:**

  1. Go to the AWS Console â†’ CloudWatch â†’ Log Groups in the Model Build account.
  2. Select a log group and check tags.
* **Expected Result:**

  * Tags such as `Environment`, `SourceAccountId`, and `ServiceName` are attached.
* **Objective:** Allow log filtering in the Governance account using tags.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **4. Service-Specific Logging Verification**

**Test Case 4: Trigger SageMaker Job and Validate Logs are Captured**

* **Preconditions:** SageMaker job logs are configured to write to CloudWatch.
* **Test Steps:**

  1. Trigger a SageMaker training job in the Model Build account.
  2. Check that logs are generated in `/aws/sagemaker/*` log group.
  3. Confirm they are visible in the Governance account.
* **Expected Result:**

  * Job logs appear in both source and Governance accounts.
* **Objective:** Validate that service-specific events (SageMaker) are correctly logged and forwarded.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **5. Governance Account Access Validation**

**Test Case 5: Search Logs from Model Build Account in Governance Console**

* **Preconditions:** Logs are already forwarded and tagged properly.
* **Test Steps:**

  1. Go to the CloudWatch Logs Insights in the Governance account.
  2. Run a query filtered by `source_account_id = <Model Build Account ID>`.
* **Expected Result:**

  * Query returns relevant logs from the Model Build account.
* **Objective:** Ensure the Platform Admin can view and query logs from any source account in a centralized manner.
