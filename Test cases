Here are suggested test case names for monitoring SageMaker AI events in CloudWatch via EventBridge, based on your user story requirements:

### SageMaker Endpoint Test Cases
1. "Verify SageMaker endpoint deployment state change events are captured in CloudWatch Logs"
2. "Validate SageMaker endpoint state change events appear in CloudWatch Logs when status changes"

### Feature Group Test Cases
3. "Confirm SageMaker feature group state change events are logged to CloudWatch"

### Hyperparameter Tuning Test Cases
4. "Test hyperparameter tuning job state changes are monitored via EventBridge to CloudWatch"

### HyperPod Test Cases
5. "Verify HyperPod cluster node health events are captured in CloudWatch Logs"
6. "Validate HyperPod cluster state change events appear in monitoring logs"

### Image/Version Test Cases
7. "Test SageMaker image state change events are logged to CloudWatch"
8. "Confirm image version state changes trigger EventBridge to CloudWatch logging"

### Model Test Cases
9. "Verify model card state changes generate CloudWatch log entries"
10. "Validate model package state change events appear in CloudWatch"
11. "Test model creation/update state changes are captured in monitoring logs"

### Pipeline Test Cases
12. "Confirm pipeline execution state changes trigger EventBridge to CloudWatch"
13. "Verify pipeline step state changes are logged to CloudWatch"

### Job Execution Test Cases
14. "Test processing job state changes appear in CloudWatch Logs"
15. "Validate training job state change events are captured"
16. "Confirm transform job state changes generate CloudWatch log entries"

### API Call Test Cases
17. "Verify SageMaker API calls are logged via CloudTrail"
18. "Validate critical API operations appear in CloudTrail logs"

### General Monitoring Test Cases
19. "Confirm EventBridge rules properly forward all SageMaker events to CloudWatch"
20. "Test log group retention policy maintains logs for required duration"

Each test case would involve:
1. Creating/triggering the relevant SageMaker resource/action
2. Verifying the event appears in the correct CloudWatch log group
3. Validating the event contains all required metadata
4. (For API tests) Confirming CloudTrail captures the API call

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific test case with detailed steps or validation criteria?
