Okay, I can help you categorize the actions from the provided IAM policies based on the ML activities you've described. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Access Required AWS Services - Permissions to access Amazon S3, Amazon ECR, Amazon CloudWatch, and Amazon EC2. Required for execution roles for jobs and endpoints.**

* **From `mlops_resource_console_access_policy`:**
    * `ecr:ListImages`
    * `ecr:DescribeRepositories`
    * `ecr:ListTagsForResource`
    * `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`
    * `s3:GetBucket*`
    * `ec2:Describe*`
    * `ec2:List*`
* **Note:** While CloudWatch permissions aren't explicitly listed in the provided policies, access to CloudWatch Logs and Metrics is often implicitly granted or managed through separate execution roles assumed by SageMaker jobs and endpoints. You might need to ensure a separate policy or the execution role associated with these activities includes `cloudwatch:Get*`, `cloudwatch:List*`, and `logs:GetLogEvents` permissions.

**2. Run Studio Classic Applications - Permissions to operate within a Studio Classic environment. Required for domain and user profile execution roles.**

* **From `mlops_sagemaker_console_access_policy`:**
    * `sagemaker:CreatePresignedDomainUrl` (Allows users to access SageMaker Studio)
    * `sagemaker:ListDomains`
    * `sagemaker:ListUserProfiles`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeDomain` (Potentially needed for understanding the Studio environment)

**3. Manage ML Jobs - Permissions to audit, query lineage, and visualize experiments.**

* **From `mlops_sagemaker_console_access_policy`:**
    * `sagemaker:ListTrainingJobs`
    * `sagemaker:ListProcessingJobs`
    * `sagemaker:ListHyperParameterTuningJobs`
    * `sagemaker:ListTrainingJobsForHyperParameterTuningJob`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeLabelingJob`
    * `sagemaker:StopLabelingJob`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeProcessingJob`
    * `sagemaker:StopProcessingJob`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeTrainingJob`
    * `sagemaker:UpdateTrainingJob`
    * `sagemaker:StopTrainingJob`
    * `sagemaker:BatchPutMetrics`
    * `sagemaker:BatchGetMetrics`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeHyperParameterTuningJob`
    * `sagemaker:DeleteHyperParameterTuningJob`
    * `sagemaker:StopHyperParameterTuningJob`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeAutoMLJobV2`
    * `sagemaker:QueryLineage` (For auditing and lineage)
    * `sagemaker:Search` (General search across SageMaker resources)
* **Note:** Visualization of experiments might also rely on Studio Classic or Studio and the permissions granted for running those applications.

**4. Manage Models - Permissions to manage SageMaker AI jobs across their lifecycles.**

* **From `mlops_sagemaker_console_access_policy`:**
    * `sagemaker:ListModels`
    * `sagemaker:DeleteModel`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeModel`
    * `sagemaker:ListTransformJobs`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeTransformJob`
    * `sagemaker:StopTransformJob`
    * `sagemaker:ListCompilationJobs`
    * `sagemaker:DeleteCompilationJob`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeCompilationJob`
    * `sagemaker:StopCompilationJob`

**5. Manage Pipelines - Permissions to manage SageMaker pipelines and pipeline executions.**

* **From `mlops_sagemaker_console_access_policy`:**
    * `sagemaker:ListPipeline*` (Includes `ListPipelines`, `ListPipelineExecutions`, `ListPipelineExecutionSteps`, etc.)

**6. Search and visualize experiments - Permissions to audit, query lineage, and visualize SageMaker AI experiments.**

* **From `mlops_deployment_console_access_policy`:**
    * `sagemaker:ListInferenceExperiments`
    * `sagemaker:ListInference*` (Broader listing of inference-related resources)
* **From `mlops_sagemaker_console_access_policy`:**
    * `sagemaker:ListArtifacts` (Related to experiment tracking)
    * `sagemaker:QueryLineage` (For auditing and lineage)
    * `sagemaker:Search` (General search across SageMaker resources, including experiments)
* **Note:** Similar to "Manage ML Jobs," visualization capabilities might be tied to Studio Classic or Studio access.

**7. Manage Model Monitoring - Permissions to manage monitoring schedules for SageMaker AI Model Monitor.**

* **From `mlops_sagemaker_console_access_policy`:**
    * `sagemaker:ListEndpoints` (Monitoring is often associated with endpoints)
    * `sagemaker:DeleteMonitoringSchedule`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeMonitoringSchedule`
    * `sagemaker:StartMonitoringSchedule`
    * `sagemaker:StopMonitoringSchedule`
    * `sagemaker:UpdateMonitoringAlert`
    * `sagemaker:UpdateMonitoringSchedule`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeModelBiasJobDefinition`
    * `sagemaker:DeleteModelBiasJobDefinition`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeDataQualityJobDefinition`
    * `sagemaker:DeleteDataQualityJobDefinition`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeModelExplainabilityJobDefinition`
    * `sagemaker:DeleteModelExplainabilityJobDefinition`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeModelQualityJobDefinition`
    * `sagemaker:DeleteModelQualityJobDefinition`

**8. Amazon S3 Full Access - Permissions to perform Amazon S3 operations.**

* **None of the provided policies grant full S3 access.** The `mlops_resource_console_access_policy` provides listing buckets and getting bucket information. Full access would typically involve actions like `s3:*` on all resources.

**9. Amazon S3 Bucket Access - Permissions to perform operations on specified Amazon S3 buckets.**

* **From `mlops_resource_console_access_policy`:**
    * `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`
    * `s3:GetBucket*`
* **Note:** To grant more specific access to particular buckets (e.g., `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject` on `arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*`), you would need to modify or create a new policy with those specific actions and resource ARNs.

**10. SageMaker Canvas Core Access - Permissions to perform experimentation in SageMaker Canvas (i.e., basic data prep, model build, validation).**

* **This is difficult to map directly to the provided policies.** SageMaker Canvas often has its own permission model and relies on a broader set of SageMaker and potentially other AWS service permissions. The provided policies don't explicitly mention Canvas-specific actions. You would likely need to consult the SageMaker Canvas documentation for the specific IAM permissions required.

**11. SageMaker Canvas Data Preparation (powered by Data Wrangler) - Permissions to perform end-to-end data preparation in SageMaker Canvas (i.e., aggregate, transform and analyze data, create and schedule data preparation jobs on large datasets).**

* **Similar to Core Access, this is hard to map directly.** Data Wrangler within Canvas would likely require permissions related to S3 access for data, SageMaker Processing Jobs, and potentially other services. The provided policies offer some relevant S3 and Processing Job permissions, but the exact set for Canvas Data Wrangler needs to be verified in the Canvas documentation.

**12. SageMaker Canvas MLOps - Permission for SageMaker Canvas users to directly deploy model to endpoint.**

* **From `mlops_deployment_console_access_policy`:**
    * `sagemaker:ListEndpoints`
    * `sagemaker:ListEndpointConfigs`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeEndpoint`
    * `sagemaker:UpdateEndpoint`
    * `sagemaker:DeleteEndpoint`
    * `sagemaker:InvokeEndpoint`
    * `sagemaker:DescribeEndpointConfig`
    * `sagemaker:DeleteEndpointConfig`
* **Note:** The conditions on these actions in the original policy (`"aws:userId": "$${aws:ResourceTag/Owner}"`) would apply here, meaning Canvas users might only be able to manage endpoints they own (if this policy is applied directly to them). Canvas might also use service roles with broader permissions for deployment.

**13. Use MLflow - Permissions to manage experiments, runs, and models in MLflow.**

* **From `mlops_sagemaker_console_access_policy`:**
    * `sagemaker:ListMlflowTrackingServers`
* **Note:** The core MLflow operations (managing experiments, runs, models) often interact with a backend store, which could be S3, a database, or the SageMaker Model Registry. The permissions required here would depend on how MLflow is configured. You might need additional S3, database, or SageMaker Model Registry permissions.

**14. Manage MLflow Tracking Servers - Permissions to manage, start, and stop MLflow Tracking Servers.**

* **From `mlops_sagemaker_console_access_policy`:**
    * `sagemaker:ListMlflowTrackingServers`
* **Note:** The provided policies don't include actions to create, start, stop, or delete MLflow Tracking Servers. You would need to identify the specific SageMaker actions for managing these servers and add them to a policy if needed.

**15. Access required to AWS Services for MLflow - Permissions for MLflow Tracking Servers to access S3, Secrets Manager, and Model Registry.**

* **From `mlops_resource_console_access_policy`:**
    * `secretsmanager:DescribeSecret`
    * `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`
    * `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`
    * `s3:GetBucket*`
* **From `mlops_sagemaker_console_access_policy`:**
    * `sagemaker:DescribeModel`
    * `sagemaker:ListModels`
* **Note:** This category describes permissions that would typically be granted to the *execution role* of the MLflow Tracking Server, not necessarily a user policy. The provided user policies grant some of these, but the MLflow server's role would need a policy tailored for its specific needs.

**16. Run Studio EMR Serverless Applications - Permissions to Create and Manage EMR Serverless Applications on Amazon SageMaker Studio.**

* **None of the provided policies explicitly include EMR Serverless actions.** You would need to identify the specific `emr-serverless:*` actions required for creating and managing applications within SageMaker Studio and create a separate policy or add them to an existing one.

**Next Steps for Your Document:**

1.  **Create Sections:** Organize your document with sections corresponding to each ML activity.
2.  **List Actions:** Under each activity, list the relevant IAM actions identified above, specifying the policy they originate from.
3.  **Clarify Scope and Conditions:** Note any conditions attached to the actions (like the "Owner" tag) and the resource scope (e.g., specific ARNs vs. `*`).
4.  **Identify Missing Permissions:** Highlight any activities where the provided policies don't seem to grant the necessary permissions (e.g., full S3 access, EMR Serverless management, specific Canvas actions).
5.  **Consider Execution Roles:** Emphasize that some activities, particularly those related to running jobs and accessing AWS services by those jobs, rely on the permissions granted to the *execution roles* associated with those services, which are separate from user console access policies.
6.  **Refer to AWS Documentation:** Encourage readers to consult the official AWS documentation for detailed information on each IAM action and service.

This structured breakdown should help you create a comprehensive document outlining the permissions provided by these MLOps console policies in the context of specific ML activities. Let me know if you have any more questions!
